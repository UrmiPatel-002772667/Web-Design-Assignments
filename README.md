HTML Tags Used in website are listed below:
1. Favicon: In the browser tab, a favicon is a little graphic that appears next to the page title. I did that and inserted a Favicon within the link tag in the head script.
2. <header>: A set of introductory information or a container for navigational links is represented by the "header" element. I made a sticky header with links to the website's navigational components.
3. <ul>/ <li>: The HTML element <ul> stands for an unordered list of elements, which is commonly shown as a bulleted list. I've included an unordered list of website navigational objects inside the navigational header element.
4. <video>: To include video material in a document, such as a movie clip or other video streams, use the "video" element. As a purely aesthetic feature, I've included the <video> tag to the main area. I also included an overlay component in the main portion. To get to the website's order page, I created a button.
5. <h1>: The most used HTML heading for marking up a web page title is the H1 tag.
6. <b>: Bold text is indicated via the <b> element without any further significance.
7. <a>: A hyperlink, which is used to connect pages, is defined by the <a> element.
8. <button>: Using the button tag, you can define a clickable button.
9. <form>: Different forms of input elements, including text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, and more, are contained under the "form" element. I've included a form for users to utilize to submit comments to the contact us page.
10. <input>: The <input> tag designates a field for user-enterable data. For the user to submit first and last names, I introduced input tags.
11. <textarea>: included a text field to collect user comments.
12. <label>: labels are defined with the <label> tag.
13. <audio>: Play, stop, and volume controls for music are now included thanks to the controls property. You can supply other audio files that the browser may select from by using the <source> element. The first format that the browser recognizes will be used. Only browsers that do not support the <audio> element will display the text in between the <audio> and </audio> tags. You may play an mp3 file right away on the order.html page to improve the user experience.
14. <table>/ <tr>/ <th>: In HTML, a table is made up of table cells inside of rows and columns.
15. <img>: I've included imagesusing <img> tag.
16. <div>: A segment or division in an HTML page is defined by the div element.
